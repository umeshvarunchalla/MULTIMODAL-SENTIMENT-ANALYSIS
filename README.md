## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate **machine learning** and **deep learning** models for sentiment analysis and meme classification using both textual and visual data.  
The work includes:

- Fake news detection using classical machine learning methods  
- Sentiment analysis of movie reviews using **BERT**  
- Multimodal meme sentiment analysis combining **text** and **image** features

## Features

### Fake News Detection
- Text preprocessing and classification using **Logistic Regression**, **Naive Bayes**, and **SVM**  
- Performance comparison with confusion matrix visualization

### Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
- Fine-tuned **BERT** model achieving **94% test accuracy** on IMDB movie review classification

### Meme Sentiment Analysis
- Combined **text and image features** to classify memes and Predicted humour, sarcasm, and offensive scores

##Methods

### Text Preprocessing
- Tokenization  
- Stopword removal  
- Feature extraction for classical ML models

### Classical Machine Learning
- Logistic Regression  
- Naive Bayes  
- Support Vector Machines (**SVM**) for fake news detection

### Deep Learning
- Fine-tuned **BERT** for movie review sentiment analysis

### Multimodal Learning
- Combined **BERT embeddings** for text with **CNN-based image features** for meme sentiment classification

## Results

- Achieved 94% accuracy using fine-tuned BERT on IMDB dataset
- Accurately classified meme sentiment and predicted humour, sarcasm, and offensive scores
